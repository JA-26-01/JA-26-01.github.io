Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hi everyone! I am Jesmine. Welcome to my little space on the world wide web!

I am a part of the POS Fraud Strategy Team at JPMorgan Chase & co. As a data analyst I look over ongoing fraud trends and study their impact so as too see whether there is a need of new strategies or modification to the existing ones. I recently completed my undergraduate degree, majoring in computer
science from VIT Chennai. Taking in the change from academic to corporate right now!

 Iâ€™m broadly interested in all aspects of machine learning, and particularly in probabilistic modeling, deep learning,data-driven systems and applications to life and engineering sciences, especially bioinformatics. My research is aligned along those fields. I am keen on getting involved in the area between software development and data science.

Random Trivia:
- In my spare time, I like to read books, paint, play my ukelele and travel with my family.
- I grew up in Agartala, India
- I can speak Korean quite well

If we chance to cross paths, feel free to say hi.
